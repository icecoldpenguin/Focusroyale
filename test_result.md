# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ PASSED - Personal task creation system working perfectly. Tested: 1) Task creation via POST /api/tasks with user_id, title, description - creates tasks with correct ownership and 3 credit reward. 2) User-specific task retrieval via GET /api/tasks/{user_id} - correctly filters by user and excludes completed tasks. 3) Task completion via POST /api/tasks/complete - awards 3 credits, updates user stats, creates activity notifications, enforces ownership (users can only complete their own tasks). 4) Completed tasks correctly removed from active lists. 5) Task ownership validation prevents cross-user task completion. All core functionality working as specified."

All 6 shop pass types verified: 1) Level Pass (100 credits) - increases user level by 1, correctly deducts credits. 2) Progression Pass (80 credits) - increases credit rate multiplier by +0.5x permanently. 3) Degression Pass (120 credits) - applies temporary -0.5x rate reduction to target for 24 hours, creates notifications. 4) Reset Pass (500 credits) - resets target user's credits to 0. 5) Ally Token (60 credits) - gives both users +1x credit rate for 3 hours with proper expiration. 6) Trade Pass (50 credits) - creates trade request requiring mutual consent. Targeting system works correctly - validates target user exists, enforces target requirements. Credit deduction working properly. Temporary effects have correct expiration times. Activity notifications created for pass usage."
