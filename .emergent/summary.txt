The AI engineer successfully addressed two distinct user requests within the provided trajectory. Initially, the core problem involved a display inconsistency where the statistics tab showed as unlocked at level 1, but its content required level 3. The AI engineer systematically explored both frontend () and backend () code, identified the three points of inconsistency, and patched them by aligning all requirements to level 3. Following this, the user requested an update to the statistics charts, specifically changing real-time activity from daily to hourly. The AI engineer again analyzed frontend chart rendering and backend data provision, identifying discrepancies. It then implemented several fixes, including updating real-time data tracking to hourly intervals, refining chart helper functions, and ensuring data consistency. The final task was to replace the application's loading screen with a custom HTML/CSS loader, which was in progress, with the HTML added and CSS being incorporated into  when the trajectory ended.

The primary user problem was an inconsistency in the statistics feature: despite being a level 1 user, the statistics tab appeared unlocked, but its content remained inaccessible, requiring level 3. This implied a mismatch in the frontend's level-based access control.

The AI engineer's work so far addressed this by:
1.  **Level Unlocking Fix:** Correcting the inconsistent level requirements for the statistics feature. The  tab definition,  function, and the statistics content rendering logic were all harmonized to require .
2.  **Statistics Charts Enhancement:** Modifying the statistics charts to ensure correct logic and functionality. Specifically, the real-time activity chart was updated to display hourly data instead of daily, and related data generation and chart rendering functions were refined for accuracy and realism.
3.  **UI Enhancement (Loading Screen):** Replacing the default application loading screen with a custom HTML/CSS animated loader provided by the user, and customizing it with the RELVL logo.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


Detailed structure and changes:

-   ****: Contains the FastAPI application.
    -   ****:
        -   **Importance:** This is the main backend file, defining API endpoints, handling business logic, and interacting with the MongoDB database. It includes the  endpoint which provides daily data for the frontend's statistics charts.
        -   **Changes Made:** The AI engineer examined this file to understand the  endpoint's data structure and determine if hourly data was available. No direct modifications to this file were observed in the provided trajectory, but its data output influenced frontend changes.

-   ****: Contains the React application.
    -   ****:
        -   **Importance:** This is the main React component, responsible for routing, managing application state, defining UI components, and integrating with the backend API. It contains the logic for tab definitions, level requirements, statistics chart rendering, and real-time activity tracking.
        -   **Changes Made:**
            -   **Lines 1810-1819 (Tab Definition):** The  for the  tab was changed from  to  to match the content's actual requirement.
            -   **Line 823 ( function):** The logic for the  tab's unlock condition was updated to  to be consistent with the new requirement.
            -   **Line 2242 (Statistics Content Render):** This line, originally , was already correct and became consistent after the above changes.
            -   **Statistics Charts Logic (Lines ~2240-2550):** Extensive modifications were made within the statistics section. This included:
                -   Refining , , and  functions to ensure they work correctly with the provided data and generate realistic outputs.
                -   Updating the real-time activity tracking mechanism to collect and display data on an hourly basis instead of every 2 seconds. This involved updating  and the associated  hook.
                -   Adjusting chart titles and descriptions to reflect the change to hourly data.
                -   Adding a missing helper function for line gradients to improve chart rendering.
            -   **Loading Screen (Unspecified lines):** The existing loading screen HTML was replaced with the new  HTML structure provided by the user, incorporating the  logo SVG path.
    -   ****:
        -   **Importance:** Contains global CSS styles for the React application.
        -   **Changes Made:** The CSS styles provided by the user for the new custom loading spinner were being appended to the end of this file to style the newly integrated loader. This was an ongoing change at the end of the trajectory.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This file serves as a communication log and documentation for testing results and problem statements.
    -   **Changes Made:** The AI engineer updated this file to document the successful fix of the statistics level requirements bug.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a new custom loading spinner, replacing the existing one in the application. The HTML structure for the new loader (including an SVG for the RELVL logo) was successfully added to . The current task involves integrating the corresponding CSS styles for this new loader. The engineer had identified  as the target file and had started the process of appending the provided CSS rules to the end of this file. The last action in the trajectory shows the engineer viewing  in preparation for adding the final CSS. This is a direct response to the user's request in Chat Message 64.
